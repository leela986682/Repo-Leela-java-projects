/*
 * Write a Java program that categorizes integers between 1 and 10,000 as Abundant and Perfect number.
In number theory, an abundant number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself.
Perfect number: In number system, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself.
Example :
The first few abundant numbers are:
12, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 42, 48, 54, 56, 60, 66, 70, 72, 78, 80, 84, 88, 90, 96, 100, 102,â€¦
The integer 12 is the first abundant number. Its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 for a total of 16.
The first perfect number is 6. Its proper divisors are 1, 2, and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.The next perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. This is followed by the perfect numbers 496 and 8128.

Create below methods:
method name: getAbundantNumber()
parameters: int start, int end
modifiers: static, public
return type :String
Logic: This method returns all abundant numbers in a String format with single space as a separator.

method name: getPerfectNumber()
parameters: int start, int end
modifiers: static, public
return type :String
Logic: This method returns all perfect numbers in a String format with single space as a separator.
