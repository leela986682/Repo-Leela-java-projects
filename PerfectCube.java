/*
 * Write a Java program to check if a number is a cube or not.
In arithmetic and algebra, the cube of a number n is its third power: the result of the number multiplied by itself twice:
n3 = n × n × n.
Create a class CheckCube(BLC):
Method name: getNum()
Parameter: int
Modifiers: public, static
return type: int
Logic: This methods checks the given parameter is a cube of any number or not, if yes then it returns the num, if the number is not a cube of any number then it returns 0.

Method name: checkCube()
Parameter: int
Modifiers: public, static
return type: void
Logic: This method calls the getNum() to find out the given number is a cube of any number or not, if the getNum() returns other than 0 then print the ____ Number is a cube of ____ else print "There is no cube of ______"

Create a ELC class named TestCube, take main method and test the code by taking the input from user.

Input Data:
Input a number: 8
Expected Output

Number is a cube of 2.
